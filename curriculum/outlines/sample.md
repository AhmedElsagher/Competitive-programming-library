### Advanced Versions [link]()

1. More complex functions and queries 
    1. Finding the minimum / maximum
    2. Search for the minimum / maximum and the number of times it occurs
    3. Search for the greatest common divisor / least common multiple
    4. Counting the number of zeros, search for kzero
    5. Combine Function
        * Example: max-sum subsegment.
2. Range updates.queries
    1. Addition on the segment
    2. Assignment on a segment
    3. Adding on a segment, requesting a maximum
3. A generalization to large dimensions
